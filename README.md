I work at [PostHog](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog), which is open source, which means I can now have Github stats and not feel disappointed:

Getting comfortable with the codebase, starting to focus on reviewing others' code. It's interesting to try and model how new changes would affect the existing code. Further, this helped uncover my blindspots - glad I started this earlier than later!

- Some interesting bug fixes: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/pull/233, https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/pull/234
  - Accompanying blog post: 
- Random odds and ends: https://github.com/PostHog/plugin-server/pull/441, https://github.com/PostHog/plugin-server/pull/447, https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/pull/236

I was Support Hero this week! It's... intense! Lots of user issues that I first have to learn about myself, and then solve. This took a surprisingly long amount of time, but was very worth it: it helped me see where actual users of PostHog get stuck.

- Built Plugin Capabilities: https://github.com/PostHog/plugin-server/pull/384, https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/4371
  - This was my first big feature: involving touching a lot of things and understanding the system, so I could come up with a decent solution. Fun stuff!
- Support fixes: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-python/pull/32

It's funny how this appears to be the least productive week so far, but I felt I got much more out of it, vs the past 2 weeks. I ought to do Support Hero more often than the usual schedule, if possible.

## 14 May 2021

- Disallow Plugins from changing the teamID: https://github.com/PostHog/plugin-server/pull/381
   - I messed up here a bit, forgot to take care of batch events (https://github.com/PostHog/plugin-server/pull/396)
- Add Sentry+Django integration to Python library: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-python/pull/13
- Bug fixes: feature flag rollout %: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-python/pull/30
- Random typos and fixes: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/4315, https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/1335

## 7 May 2021

Week 1 at PostHog!

- Build a new plugin - the Downsampling Plugin: https://github.com/PostHog/downsampling-plugin/pull/1
- Add support for `$set` and `$set_once` to Python library: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-python/pull/23
   - I messed up here a bit: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-python/pull/28 - be moaar careful about tests that don't pass on local but pass on master
   - Interesting difference in workflow causing bugs: I didn't think of pulling master because I'm used to working off of forks, vs pre-existing branches
- Random typos and fixes: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/4220, https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/1307, https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/1316
