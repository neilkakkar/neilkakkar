I work at [PostHog](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog), which is open source, which means I can now have Github stats and not feel disappointed:

Week 1 at PostHog!

- Build a new plugin - the Downsampling Plugin: https://github.com/PostHog/downsampling-plugin/pull/1
- Add support for `$set` and `$set_once` to Python library: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-python/pull/23
   - I messed up here a bit: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-python/pull/28 - be moaar careful about tests that don't pass on local but pass on master
   - Interesting difference in workflow causing bugs: I didn't think of pulling master because I'm used to working off of forks, vs pre-existing branches
- Random typos and fixes: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/4220, https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/1307, https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/1316
