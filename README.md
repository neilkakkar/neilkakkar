I work at [PostHog](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog), which is open source, which means I can now have Github stats and not feel disappointed:

Who knew playing around with SQL, and generating interesting queries could be so much fun? This week was more dakka: more add ons, more functionality to the basic funnel APIs. Some clever refactoring + testing mechanisms, that I enjoyed setting up

- Interesting test infra setup with Funnel Breakdowns - https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/5043
- Refactoring to remove obsolete concepts - https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/5037
- Bells and whistles - https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/5024
- Random bug fixes: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/5055


## 2 July 2021

Some big funnel improvements

- Remember to create tests for backwards compatibility! - https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/4946
- Unordered funnels, people, and more - https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/4943, https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/4890

## 25 June 2021

I was getting pretty comfortable with my role, and that seemed like the best time to switch teams ðŸ˜‚. Purely co-incidental, we shifted focus, and I've been writing wonderful SQL this week. Damn, this is SO MUCH FUN. This week (and hopefully the coming few weeks, really want to brush up on my querying skills). This has been very helpful: https://pgexercises.com/

- Some complex funnels: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/4868, https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/4863
- When revisiting setting up, always update docs for whoever comes after you :) - https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/1506

## 18 June 2021

Finishing up new processes for the Plugin Developer Experience, plus excellent docs.

- https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-plugin-starter-kit/pull/7, https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/1467
- Fun bug fixes: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/4772
- Odds and ends: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/4755, https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/1497

## 11 June 2021

Well, plugin installation is deprioritized for now. New focus: plugin development experience! Lots of time spent thinking about how the documentation should look like, what workflows should the code promote, and what feels confusing.

- Making the Plugin Development Experience nicer: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/1467, https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/4688
- Wrangling with BigQuery: https://github.com/PostHog/bigquery-plugin/pull/9
   - Good Habit of mind - when things are hard to debug, write code to make it easier to debug similar issues in the future: https://github.com/PostHog/plugin-server/pull/465

## 4 June 2021

Thinking about a big project, and learning enough about the interacting systems to design a decent solution can be hard! Really looking forward to finishing the plugin installation step.

- Plugin Install Step: https://github.com/PostHog/plugin-server/issues/405, https://github.com/PostHog/plugin-server/pull/456
- Debugging S3 Queues: https://github.com/PostHog/plugin-server/pull/451

## 28 May 2021

Getting comfortable with the codebase, starting to focus on reviewing others' code. It's interesting to try and model how new changes would affect the existing code. Further, this helped uncover my blindspots - glad I started this earlier than later!

- Some interesting bug fixes: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/pull/233, https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/pull/234
  - Accompanying blog post: 
- Random odds and ends: https://github.com/PostHog/plugin-server/pull/441, https://github.com/PostHog/plugin-server/pull/447, https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/pull/236


## 21 May 2021

I was Support Hero this week! It's... intense! Lots of user issues that I first have to learn about myself, and then solve. This took a surprisingly long amount of time, but was very worth it: it helped me see where actual users of PostHog get stuck.

- Built Plugin Capabilities: https://github.com/PostHog/plugin-server/pull/384, https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/4371
  - This was my first big feature: involving touching a lot of things and understanding the system, so I could come up with a decent solution. Fun stuff!
- Support fixes: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-python/pull/32

It's funny how this appears to be the least productive week so far, but I felt I got much more out of it, vs the past 2 weeks. I ought to do Support Hero more often than the usual schedule, if possible.

## 14 May 2021

- Disallow Plugins from changing the teamID: https://github.com/PostHog/plugin-server/pull/381
   - I messed up here a bit, forgot to take care of batch events (https://github.com/PostHog/plugin-server/pull/396)
- Add Sentry+Django integration to Python library: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-python/pull/13
- Bug fixes: feature flag rollout %: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-python/pull/30
- Random typos and fixes: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/4315, https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/1335

## 7 May 2021

Week 1 at PostHog!

- Build a new plugin - the Downsampling Plugin: https://github.com/PostHog/downsampling-plugin/pull/1
- Add support for `$set` and `$set_once` to Python library: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-python/pull/23
   - I messed up here a bit: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-python/pull/28 - be moaar careful about tests that don't pass on local but pass on master
   - Interesting difference in workflow causing bugs: I didn't think of pulling master because I'm used to working off of forks, vs pre-existing branches
- Random typos and fixes: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/4220, https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/1307, https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/1316
